DESIGN PHASE

The design phase of my developer portfolio focused on creating a clean, accessible, and responsive interface that reflects both my technical skills and passion for AI and tech inclusivity. I began with low-fidelity wireframes that i drew on paper  and chose a minimalist layout to ensure clarity and ease of navigation. A navy blue and soft purple color scheme was selected to convey professionalism and creativity, while semantic HTML5 elements were planned for SEO optimization. The layout was structured around key sections:home, about, skills, education,interests,projects,blog,contact. The accessibility features like Deaf/Blind mode toggles considered for future implementation. Overall, the design emphasizes simplicity, user experience, and inclusivity.I decided to use Iterative Method as it allows one to iterate easily in case changes occur.


DEVELOPMENT PHASE

1.Tech Stack
I used is Html5, CSS3 and Git and GitHub for Code track changes and also manage different versions of my project

2.Project Structure
/Myportfolio-project
│
├── index.html
├── blog.html
├── style.css
├── /assets
│   └── images, profile photo, icons, etc.
└── README.md

3. Development Strategy
I adopted a desktop-first approach, designing and building the layout for larger screens first, then adapting it to smaller devices .Development was done incrementally whereby i started with static HTML structure, followed by section-by-section CSS styling.which is characteristic of iterative development.
This allows for continuous testing  making it easier to catch and fix issues early. I kept the structure semantic and accessible to ensure good SEO and usability.
   
4.Version Control Workflow
Initialized with git init
Regular commits with meaningful messages
Pushed to GitHub for backup and sharing.
