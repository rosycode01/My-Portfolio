DESIGN PHASE

The design phase of my developer portfolio focused on creating a clean, accessible, and responsive interface that reflects both my technical skills and passion for AI and tech inclusivity. I began with low-fidelity wireframes that i drew on paper  and chose a minimalist layout to ensure clarity and ease of navigation. A navy blue and soft purple color scheme was selected to convey professionalism and creativity, while semantic HTML5 elements were planned for SEO optimization. The layout was structured around key sections:home, about, skills, education,interests,projects,blog,contact. The accessibility features like Deaf/Blind mode toggles considered for future implementation. Overall, the design emphasizes simplicity, user experience, and inclusivity.I decided to use Agile methodology as it organises the development process in sprints whch allow one to iterate easily in case changes occur
